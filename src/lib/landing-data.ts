    a: "RemConnect is strictly dedicated to providing opportunities to candidates based in Ethiopia. We have a global outreach and pool of clients from around the world looking to hire top professionals in Ethiopia.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are certifications and degrees required for every position? Do we need prior experience to get hired?",
    a: "No. Certifications and/or degrees can help boost your profile but won't definitively determine hiring status. Experience can also aid the process but lack of experience won't deter it. Above all, complete your profile to the best of your ability so we can make the best decision for your fit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do candidates pay to apply for jobs?",
    a: "No. Do not respond to any inquiry asking for payment of any kind. RemConnect will never ask you to pay fees for any reason.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a specific age limit to apply for jobs?",
    a: "Candidates applying to the platform must be at least 18 years old.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do candidates apply directly to jobs or submit documents and wait?",
    a: "A combination of both. Once you submit all required information, you'll be given next steps by an administrator. If multiple opportunities match your skillset, we'll register you for all applicable jobs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a LinkedIn account necessary for applying?",
    a: "Yes. A LinkedIn account is absolutely necessary. It shows us, among many things, your level of professionalism, expertise, experience, and education.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do we sign a contract? If so, how long is the term?",
    a: "Yes. A contract is composed before training along with waivers and disclosures regarding company procedure. Contracts will be renewed based on demand. Internal full-time and part-time offers won't have a termination date; all other contracts have termination dates with an option of extension.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do we get paid?",
    a: "Payments are made to your preferred bank of choice. Currency varies by opportunity. You will get a detailed stub that shows your term length, payment amount, bonus/commission amount (if applicable), and any other relevant items.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long is the hiring process? When should I expect a response?",
    a: "Turnaround time depends on the position and job availability. Urgent hires can expect to begin training within a month of interviewing. All other opportunities vary in turnaround time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is training administered? Where will the training be?",
    a: "Training is held completely virtually. It typically lasts 2-6 weeks depending on the position and is usually determined by our client. You'll get more instructions once you are interviewed and onboarded.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where do we upload documents?",
    a: "All documents should be uploaded in your portal. If it doesn't work, please email docs to our HR manager at bezamariam@remconnect.io.",
